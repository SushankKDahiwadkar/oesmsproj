                <p><i>“Just Do It! If You Win, You Will Lead, If You Lose, You Will Guide”</i></p>
                <p>Believing in above lines, I am starting up this new activity of blogging, sharing. I love to read and write. Well, I won’t claim I am a huge reader and deep writer. But, I am able to write what I want to say. It was my urge to write, and I can’t keep it inside anymore, so I have selected this channel to share my thoughts, my knowledge.</p>
                <p>I am Sushank Dahiwadkar, a free man in this free world. By profession I am Computer Engineer. I belong to a great nation, India. I own really a good life. A good career, a perfect family, loving wife, awesome friends, I have this all. Is this enough for introduction?</p>
                <p>Everyone has a set of dreams (it should be a dream, butwe have lot of dreams), we wish that all of them should come true. But, trust me they won’t come true unless you fight to achieve them. I also have lot of dreams, and one of those is “writing articles”. I call it as dream because, I want to write and pass it over to you guys to read and also want to hear back from you. This is not very easy to achieve, so I call it as a dream.</p>
                <p>As I am computer engineer, I have some knowledge of my field. Then it’s but obvious that my more articles would be technical related to computer science, programming, new technologies, new innovations and whatever else I can share.</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that I am free man in this free world. I do have my views. Lot of things happen here. As we are globalized we get every update at the next moment. I would share my views on the things I find important. This will not be very often, but yes I will share this too.</p>
                <p>You won’t find the design of my blog in very good shape. Because I feel, rather decorating the blogs with fantastic designs, I wish to decorate my blogs with knowledge. But whenever I will get time, I will try to make design better.</p>
                <p>I am beginning this new journey, and really wish to walk very far down this path. On this path I would really need your wishes, suggestions and support. I will make sure whatever I am sharing will be the best content. And I will try to be very regular with my blogs. Thanks for reading this far, this means yes I can catch your attention. Cheers!</p>

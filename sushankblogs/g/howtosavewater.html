                <p class="headline">How To Save Water</p>
                <p>Nowadays everywhere we get to read and hear <i>“Please use water carefully”</i>, right? Is it that serious? It was very wrong of me to ask such stupid question. But yes, some people don’t have that seriousness about saving water. Earth has lot of water. It is true, but unfortunately all that is not drinkable, not useable. We have very less water in stock to use. Look around and think on the situation how important is to save water. Here are some tips how we can save water.</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you fill your glass to drink the water, take only that much water you want to drink. If you feel that you still want to drink, take another glass. But don’t take excessive water.</li>
                        <li>Keep a bucket beside your drinking water place. Rather throwing extra water into sink, put it in that bucket. This water can be used for any extra work, like cleaning.</li>
                        <li>Avoid taking shower, instead use bucket for bathing.</li>
                        <li>Close the taps properly after you done using them.</li>
                        <li>Water you garden with bucket and mug instead of hosepipe.</li>
                        <li>Keep a bucket under your air conditioner’s water outlet. This water can be use any extra work.</li>
                        <li>While shaving don’t keep the tap open. Instead use a mug, this can save lot of water.</li>
                        <li>Replace your toilet flush tanks with the new ones. Old flush tanks pours 9 liters of water at a time.</li>
                        <li>Use modern water conservation techniques. This could help us to increase the water level of earth. If the water level of earth increases, we won’t have to beg for water.</li>
                        <li>Last but not the least. You excessive use of water. Save the water by any way you can save it. Because not even a single living thing could survive without water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
